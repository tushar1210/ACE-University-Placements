# A minimal guide on how to ACE University Placements for CS Undergrads ðŸš€

#### Before I start rambling and giving unwanted 'gyaan', I would like to give a brief background about myself so that whoever is reading this can adjust the timelines for themselves accordingly.
I am doing my undergrad (2021) from VIT University, Vellore in Computer Science, with a CGPA of 8.37 (This ain't great or that bad, but it is advised to have a CGPA >= 8.5 believe me, this will help you a lot.) I started preparing for the campus placements in March 2020 and my placements were to start from July 2020 (again, better to start early.) I had prior development experience (personal projects) in Node.js, Swift, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Doing projects can be a great point on your resume but that isn't everything that you would be needing to get into a good company. With that said, I'll start with it.

## ðŸŒŸ Areas to focus on (TS-BAD):
1. Theory :
    - Computer Networks (CN)
    - Operating Systems (OS)
    - Database Management Systems (DBMS)

2. System Design (Basics)
3. Behavioral Questions
4. Aptitude Questions
5. Data Structures and Algorithms (most important)

## ðŸŒŸ Theory Sources :
1. Computer Networks :
    - [Geeks For Geeks](https://tushar.wtf/data/cn.html)
    - [Gate Smashers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFF2vJaN0Cw&list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGFBD2-2joCpWOLUrDLvVV_) (Great for understanding subnetting)
    
2. Operating System :
    - [Geeks For Geeks](https://tushar.wtf/data/os.html)
    - [Gate Smashers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkSWJJZNgf8&list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGz9donHRrE9I3Mwn6XdP8p)

3. Database Management System :
    - [Geeks For Geeks](https://tushar.wtf/data/db.html)
    - [Gate Smashers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdlM6hNDAE&list=PLxCzCOWd7aiFAN6I8CuViBuCdJgiOkT2Y)

## ðŸŒŸSystem Design :
The only source that you'll need for System Design is [GKCS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnVSmNFX0&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX). <br> Big shoutout to [@gkcs_](https://twitter.com/gkcs_?lang=en) .

## ðŸŒŸBehavioral Questions :
This is a section where you are going to introduce your 'real' self to the interviewers, and hence there is no fixed source to prepare on this, but for me [this](https://www.themuse.com/advice/30-behavioral-interview-questions-you-should-be-ready-to-answer) worked. Do check out [this](https://theinterviewguys.com/behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers-101/) link for some sample behavioural questions. The pragmatic and structured method most commonly used in behavioural/managerial rounds is the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method), so do tailor your answers based on this. <br>
On an extra note, do some research on the company you apply for. A basic review of Products, News, Culture, etc. will be benificial in the HR round. HR rounds are make or break moments, so do check out this link for structing [situational](https://theinterviewguys.com/situational-interview-questions-and-answers-examples-included/) responses.

## ðŸŒŸAptitude Questions :
The one stop to verbal and and quants aptitude is [indiabix](https://www.indiabix.com). <br> If you are familiar with GRE syllabus, that also works.

## ðŸŒŸData Structures and Algorithms:
I can't appreciate [this course](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/dsa-self-paced?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4f35BRDBARIsAPePBHxfINfOiO8KmU4g1j6DxOG-RO5YZM5mAN0CPVsIivjFcue4unarOSUaAjvWEALw_wcB) enough. It is concise, to the point and covers all  the important topics. Though it costs around â‚¹2500 (at the time of me writing) but it is worth it. 

Important topics in Data Structures :

- Recursion 
- Arrays
- Searching (binary search, two pointer technique)
- Sorting (bubble, insertion, merge, selection, quick, heap, Lomuto and Hoare's partitions)
- Strings
- Matrices
- Linked Lists 
- Hashing (Set and Map)
- Stack
- Queue, Dequeue
- Trees (Binary, BST, n-arry)
- Heap (max-heap, min-heap)
- Graphs

Approach techniques :
- Greedy 
- Dynamic Programing

Though the Geeks for geeks course covers almost everything I would recommend you to check out this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqowUJzG-iM&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go) by [Aditya Verma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaverma1999/)
this is the best video resource to learn dp hands down, dude unlocks your thinking capacity.<br><br><br>

## Where to practice from ?
This is a question which 90% of your batchmates would be having. Now this is what I did and it might be wrong for you but worked for me. I practiced around 20-100 most popular problems each for the above mentioned topics from [Geeks for geeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/home/). After this I moved on to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), to utilize leetcode at its max efficiency see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q15JgVVLXQg&t=578s) by [Rachit Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachitiitr/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3B9NsQDx9LSh%2BWO%2FkNVPP8pA%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=xe4C%2FfhOTiGTSQ4snAEHIQ%3D%3D). After feeling confident about leetcode problems try to move on to [Interview Bit Problems](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/) if you have time left.
<br>Also, if possible do take part in code chef rated challenges. <br><br> One last thing, do not forget all the other areas to focus on, or else it will be very hard for you to clear Interview rounds after the Online Round.

*if I feel any thing major is left out I'll update this doc also, if you have any suggestions/modifications, please make a PR.
